# COVID-19

This Repository contains daily updates on the confirmed Covid-19 cases, recoveries and deceased from 01.23.2020 till 03.09.2023 The data presented was aggregated from [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

<b>Changes:</b>

* Time series data was used to aggregate the datasets in ./data.
* All time series were pruned such that roughly the latter half of the data is missing, because time series data does not contain information about recovered cases after the cut off date.
* All data that wasn't aggregated was removed
